# DevTool
Our development app for the IPD project!

By AP Hogeschool @ 2014 - 2015

#What?
This will be an app where we test a lot of stuff!
It's our first time programming Android.

We will implement:
-  A nice and simple GUI
-  A stopwatch with TTS
-  We will try to measure the heigt of the phone (With the accelero and rotation sensor)
-  A connection with a database using JSON

We're working together with students abroad to make a wallclimbing app!
